Usage:
-  create a csv file named import.csv and write "keywords" in the first cell (this is a must. see sample import.csv for example)
-  ![csv file header example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44648395/133727864-44d04745-694f-438e-bd9b-4d81016e297c.png)

-  you must put this csv file in the folder where you extracted the source code (in step 7 above)
-  doubke click "Insta Hashtag Survey.py" file and wait a few moments for the browser to open
-  wait till the browser goes to instagram log in page by itself
-  log in by typing your username and password
-  when the browser goes to instagram homepage after sign up go to the python window
-  you will see "Log in and press enter to continue..."
-  so, press enter and sit back :)

 Note - try to scrap less than 800/1000 keywords at a single time and give a fair break between each runs
